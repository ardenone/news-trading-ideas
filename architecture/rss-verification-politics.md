## Recommendations

### Critical Issues
1. **Politico Feeds Completely Blocked:** All 5 Politico feeds cannot be accessed via WebFetch. Consider:
   - Testing with different user-agent headers
   - Using RSS proxy service
   - Contacting Politico for API access
   - Removing from feed list if inaccessible in production

2. **CNN Feed Connection Error:** HTTP/HTTPS mismatch or TLS issue. Try:
   - Update URL to HTTPS: `https://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss`
   - Test alternate CNN politics feeds

3. **NYT Feed Blocked:** Similar to Politico. May require:
   - NYT Developer API access
   - RSS proxy service
   - Alternative NYT feed URLs

4. **The Hill Finance Feed Empty:** Feed exists but no articles. Investigate:
   - Check if this is temporary
   - Contact The Hill support
   - Consider removing if permanently empty
